## Project Overview

To better understand the behavior of Citi Bike’s customer base (both one-time users and subscribers) and how they use Citi Bikes
This will help us to:

-Identify where more bikes should be installed

-Create targeted marketing campaigns that will appeal to different customer segments

## Data Source

Sales Data: The primary dataset used in this analysis is the "Copy of New York Citi Bikes_Raw Data.xlsx" file, containing customers usage data by the company.

### Tools 

- Google Sheets - Data Cleaning and Analysis
- PowerPoint - Creating Reports

### Data Cleaning
The following process was followed:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Deleting unnecessary columns
3. Identifying and remove duplicates
4. Checking for missing data and outliers
5. Checking for inconsistencies and wrong data format

### Exploratory Data Analysis
This process involved answering the following questions
- What are the most popular pick-up locations across the city for Citi Bike rental?
- How does the average trip duration vary across different age groups?
- Which age group rents the most bikes?
- How does bike rental vary across the two user groups (one-time users vs long-term subscribers) on different days of the week? 
- Does the factor of user age impact the average bike trip duration?

### Data Analysis
This process involved the use of google sheets for
- Descriptive statistics such as mean, median, maximum and minimum values
- Pivot tables to make immediate comparisons and calculations

### Findings
1. Top 5 pick-up locations for bikes: 
Grove St Path, Exchange Place, Sip Ave, Hamilton Park, & Morris Canal are the top 5 pick-up locations for renters
2. Customer base: 
Citi Bike’s customer base cuts across all demographics with the middle aged customers being its biggest renters while its older customers being its longest riders averagely
3. Citi Bike customer behavior:
Customers aged 75+ take the longest trips while customers aged 65-74 take the shortest trips averagely.

### Recommendations
1. Product recommendations:
Install more bikes at Grove St PATH, Exchange Place, Sip Ave, Hamilton Park, Morris Canal.
2. Marketing recommendations:
The Citi Bike customer base is mostly subscribers between the ages of 35-44, who are most active on weekdays.This tells us that they are probably people who live in New York and use Citi Bikes to commute. Marketing and advertising campaigns should therefore target this particular demographic.

### Limitations
I had to remove several duplicate values, missing data points and blank cells. This was to ensure they didn't interfere with the accuracy of the analysis.
